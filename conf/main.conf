# Conf's

####
# IP address used for redirection requests.
# If commented out, czhttpd will attempt to determine
# your local ip using either /proc/net/tcp (linux) or
# `ifconfig` (osx, *bsd) with a fallback to 127.0.0.1.
# IP_REDIRECT=127.0.0.1

####
# Filter IPs that do not match the given regex pattern.
# This is extremely primitive since we can't restrict
# which ip's can connect to our tcp socket, but we can
# disconnect those clients whose address do not match
# the given rule. By default, czhttpd accepts all ip ranges.
# IP_ACCEPT="192.168.1.[0-9*]"

####
# TCP port to bind to
# PORT=8080

####
# Maximum number of concurrent connections to
# accept. Czhttpd spawns a new process for each
# incoming connection so *do not* set this too high.
# MAX_CONN=12

####
# Enable HTTP keep-alive in HTTP/1.1 response headers.
# If disabled czhttpd closes every connection after a
# single request.
# HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE=1

####
# Number of seconds before timing out http
# connections. Since we're dealing with a
# limited number of connections latency is more
# important than scalability so keep this >5.
# HTTP_TIMEOUT=30

####
# Number of seconds to wait for incoming data on our
# socket. This isn't a culminative timeout so keep it
# fairly low since read/sysread are called multiple
# times when reading a single request and czhttpd
# will not keep track of the time elapsed since the
# last call.
# HTTP_RECV_TIMEOUT=5

####
# Maximum size in bytes for the optional message body
# in a request. Default: 16K
# HTTP_BODY_SIZE=16384

####
# Default index file
# INDEX_FILE=index.html

####
# Display hidden files in directory listings
# HIDDEN_FILES=0

####
# Follow sym links in directory listings
# FOLLOW_SYMLINKS=0

####
# Enable/Disable logging
# LOG=0

####
# Log to file. To send log output to stdout use the cli
# option `-v`.
# LOG_FILE=~/.config/czhttpd/log/

####
# Directory caching. Disabled by default. If enabled, czhttpd
# will store a copy of all generated html pages in $CACHE_DIR
# and force a rebuild for the next request upon detecting any
# modified files/dirs.
# CACHE=0

####
# Directory to stored cached pages
# CACHE_DIR=/tmp/.czhttpd-$$/
