czhttpd: simple linux http server written in 99% pure zsh

This is *not* intended for serious use. It has terrible security and was never designed to be portable. Just a toy that I've been playing with to see what I can do with zsh. That being said, it's found some use in quickly serving files in a *firewalled* local network without having to screw around with nfs or samba.

Requirements:
- `file`

TODO:
- CGI
