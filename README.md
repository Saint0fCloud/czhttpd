czhttpd: simple http server written in zsh

This is *not* intended for serious use. Just a toy that I've been playing with to see what I can do with zsh.

TODO:
- Canonicalize paths properly
    - Navigate up to parent
    - Fix for files with spaces?
- zparseopts: better configuration
- error handling & logging
